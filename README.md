Figure out what entities you'll need, and what relationships they should have.  Some possible entities: Order, Restaurant, MenuItem, User

Visualize the schema using [Quick Database Diagrams](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/).

Implement the schema following the model of [cars database](https://github.com/Code-Platoon-Assignments/sql-cars). 

Write a few queries against it to make sure everything is working.
