Figure out what entities you'll need, and what relationships they should have.  Some possible entities: Order, Restaurant, MenuItem, User

Visualize the schema [Quick Database Diagrams](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/).

Implement the schema following the model of [cars database](https://github.com/echoplatoonew/cars_database). 

When you have your postgres container running with your database, write a few queries against it to make sure everything is working.
